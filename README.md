# Business Insights for Music Store

We'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. 
The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. 
The tables store information about the employees, customers and also the music.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, 
as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven seperate tables.
